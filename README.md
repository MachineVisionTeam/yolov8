# YOLOv8 Nucleus Detection

## Introduction

This repository implements nucleus detection using the YOLOv8 architecture. The model is trained on the NuCLS dataset, containing labeled nuclei from breast cancer images obtained from TCGA. The primary goal is to accurately detect and segment nuclei within microscopy images for various biomedical applications.

## Installation

To run the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
